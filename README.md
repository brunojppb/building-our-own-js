This project demonstrates how Interpreted languages work with
a fully functional expression evaluator like in the JavaScript language.

## Features

This project has the following features to demonstrate how interpreted languages work:

- [x] Lexer

## Running this project on your machine

First, you must have installed:

- [x] [NodeJS 20](https://nodejs.org/en) or above
- [x] [pnpm 9](https://pnpm.io/) or above

This project uses [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to manage those dependencies, so if you install Volta, you should be good to go.

Now install the dependencies with:

```shell
pnpm install
```

And run the dev server with:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

The server should be available at `http://localhost:3000`
